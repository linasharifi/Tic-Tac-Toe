;; Useful utility functions

; Returns the number of elements in l for which the predicate f
; evaluates to #t. For example:
;
;    (count (lambda (x) (> x 0)) '(-5 0 1 -3 3 4)) => 3
;    (count (lambda (x) (= x 0)) '(-5 0 1 -3 3 4)) => 1
(define (count f l)
  (cond [(empty? l) 0]
        [(f (car l)) (add1 (count f (cdr l)))]
        [else (count f (cdr l))]))

;; Your solution begins here

; Check whether a list is a valid board
(define (board? lst)
  'todo)

;;; From the board, calculate who is making a move this turn
(define (next-player board)
  'todo)

;;; If player ('X or 'O) want to make a move, check whether it's this
;;; player's turn and the position on the board is empty ('E)
(define (valid-move? board row col player)
  'todo)

;;; To make a move, replace the position at row col to player ('X or 'O)
(define (make-move board row col player)
  'todo)

;;; To determine whether there is a winner?
(define (winner? board)
  'todo)

;;; The board is the list containing E O X 
;;; Player will always be 'O
;;; returns a pair of x and y
(define (calculate-next-move board player)
  'todo)
